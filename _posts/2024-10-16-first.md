Welcome to my first post on my portfolio! In this post, I’ll be sharing my journey as a developer and the projects I’ve been working on.


### My Portfolio Website
I recently created this portfolio website using Jekyll. (To be honest, most of the code I have written is taken from the internet as a reference, and I made some changes to it. I couldn’t have made this project easily without references and internet guidance. This is actually my first project, so...cheers and celebrations for me!) so, here are some key things,

- A clean design with a black and blue theme.
- A responsive layout that works well on mobile devices.
- Easy navigation through my projects and blog posts.

Also, I’m working on a file organizer. I have written the core logic and will soon add a GUI for it (learning Java Swing for that).

## Conclusion

Thank you for visiting my portfolio. Stay tuned for more updates and projects, and have a great day!
